Pleased to make you acquaintance.
I hope to be of use to you somehow.

[BeginDialogue]
How are you today?
[EndDialogue]

[BeginDialogue]
Oh, hello. Out gathering materials for your spellcrafting? If you have any questions about the arcane, feel free to ask my anytime.
[EndDialogue]

[BeginDialogue=1Heart]
Greetings. I am on a walk to recharge my mana.
Would you care to join me? There is a nice breeze today and the spirits are out frolicking about.
[EndDialogue]

[BeginDialogue]
Ah, the witch from the tower in the forest. How have you been faring?
[EndDialogue]

[BeginDialogue=2Heart]
...
Ah!
Sorry I was a bit lost in thought.
Oh, what was I thinking about? Well, family matters, as usual.
It can be quite tedious, but I don't really have a choice in whether I'm involved really.
[EndDialogue]

[BeginDialogue=GiftLove]
I suppose I would expect a witch to know what a wizard desires.
Thank you, I truly am grateful for all you do for me.
[EndDialogue]

[BeginDialogue=GiftLike]
For me? You're too kind.
[EndDialogue]

[BeginDialogue=GiftNeutral]
Oh, thank you.
[EndDialogue]

[BeginDialogue=GiftDislike]
You may have more... valuable ideas for what to do with this, but I will take it off your hands if you insist.
