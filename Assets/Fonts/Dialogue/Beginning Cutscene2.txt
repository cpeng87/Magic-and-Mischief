[BeginDialogue]
I can't believe you'll be moving away so soon though.
I still remember when you arrived at my doorstep all those years ago, tightly grasping your father's hand...
And now look at you all grown up!
I'll really miss you by my side, but I'll let you free to explore and learn on your own now,
After all you're a fully fledged witch!
Heading out now?
You have the map right?
And your staff and spellbook?
Ah, alright, alright, I'll try to stop worrying so much. But you've never been outside the forest so I can't help but worry...
Safe travels darling, and good luck!
Feel free to visit me, if you can figure out teleportation on your own!
And as your mother always said:
Mysteries will find those who seek it!
